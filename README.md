Solving Lunar Lander Problem using Double Q learning

All lunarlander2 files can be immediately run by executing the code in any IDE

class_utils2 and the different iterations are the agent's code, the files labeled with DQN are for the DQN agent
and the unlabeled ones are for DDQN.



The files tagged with runmodels are modified versions to accommodate the lunarlander2_DDQN_pretrained and lunarlander2_DQN_pretrained


 

Lunarlander2_DDQN/Lunarlander2_DQN 

 - both these files are the main functions that will create an agent and train them. 

Lunarlander2_DDQN_pretrained/Lunarlander2_DQN_pretrained

 - these files will use the trained networks to attempt to solve lunar lander



lunarlanderrandom is a randomly acting agent.
